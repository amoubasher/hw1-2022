Homework One - SEO Optimization
This challenge was designed for the student to learn how to go through existing code and improve upon what is already there.
These improvements are called code refactoring, which makes the website optimized for search engines, user readibility, and code sensibility.
Going through the code without making significant changes to the view of the website is the main goal of this challenge. 
As a student, I went through the HTML and changed tags & elements that better suited the HTML readibility for search engines as well as user usability. Some tags were changed that better suited the content that they had to portray. Alts were added to img to help user accessibility. 
I also went through the CSS and refactored some of the existing code in order to make the "cascading" element of CSS work in a sensible manner. Some redundant code was combined into one block of code in order to elimate the redundancy and help whoever would work on the code later be able to manipulate one selector instead of three different ones that basically do the same thing.


Comments were added into the HTML as well as the CSS so any coder that works on this code after me will know what was changed and will be able to revert to the original if needed.
